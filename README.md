# MetaMask Integration
This project demonstrates how to integrate MetaMask with a web application using JavaScript and the Web3.js library. MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, allowing users to securely manage their digital assets and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) directly from their web browser.

## Features:
Connect to MetaMask: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the web application with a single click.
Display Wallet Information: Once connected, the application retrieves and displays the user's wallet address, ETH balance, and USDT balance.
Install MetaMask: If MetaMask is not detected, users are prompted to install it with a link to the official website.

## Technologies Used:
HTML/CSS: Frontend structure and styling using Bulma CSS framework.
JavaScript: Backend logic to interact with MetaMask and fetch wallet information.
Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and MetaMask.
